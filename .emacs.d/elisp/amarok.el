;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a simple interface to play music in Amarok.  It
;; just provides some basic commands to pause/play and manipulate
;; playlist.  Its primary use is for control from Dired, while browsing
;; your music collection there.
;;
;; For convenience, a command, `amarok-setup-dired-key-bindings', is
;; provided for setting up useful keybindings in Dired. Use that or
;; create your own bindings.
