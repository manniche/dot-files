# Print postcard-sized (148x100mm, 5.8 x 3.9in) images
# on a Canon Selphy CP1200 and compatible photo printers

# Usage: print-selphy-postcard [--border] <file>

# Configuration parameters:

# Printer name
# Set Wi-Fi printer name, as seen by CUPS.
#
# Corresponding printer entry in CUPS configuration should be something like:
# dnssd://Canon%20SELPHY%20CP1200._ipp._tcp.local/?uuid=<uuid>
#
# To produce that entry for a new printer, use CUPS printer autodetection
# (usually http://localhost:631 , Administration / Add Printer menu) while
# mDNS service discovery is enabled.
#
PRINTER="Canon_SELPHY_CP1200"

# End of configuration parameters.
