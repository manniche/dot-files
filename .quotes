The last project that I worked on with Richard [Feynman] was in
simulated evolution. ... When I got back to Boston I went to the
library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my
disappointment, all of our "discoveries" were covered in the first few
pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was
elated. "Hey, we got it right!" he said. "Not bad for amateurs."

The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there
is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding
information.

The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland";
but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.

All movements go too far.

There's a saying in German about the perfect being the enemy of

If I could change one thing, I might try to interest some early
preliterate people in not using their thumbs when they count.

For software, we have this weird world with these weird, really
bizarre fundamental properties [...] I don't look around and see
anything that looks like an address or a pointer. We have objects;
we don't have these weird things that computer scientists misname
'objects'.

Every now and then I feel a temptation to design a programming
language but then I just lie down until it goes away.

But to me the idea of the right kind of a program is something
that matches the way I think as cloosely as possible rather than
something that matches the machine as closely as possible.
- Don Knuth

These days, I always point out that you've got to make programs so
that they are testable. And the only way to make a program
testable is to think about that before you write the first line of
code.

You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline - it
helps if you have some kind of football team, or some nuclear weapons,
but at the very least you need a beer

I once had a girlfriend who went to hear me talk for 90 minutes about
LALR(1) parser generators [...] Needless to say, I married her.

While the author's wildly swerwing train of thought did at one point
flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance

there is no reward for emacs except the experience of using emacs, and
nothing to be learned by it except humility

While Java has plenty of other opportunities to create non-thread-safe
code, I am not going to create an entirely new and nearly irresistible
vector for doing so.  Iteration and side-effects are how we've been
trained to do things in Java, but we have to learn to do better.

Note that nobody reads every post in linux-kernel. In fact, nobody who
expects to have time left over to actually do any real kernel work
will read even half. Except Alan Cox, but he's actually not human, but
about a thousand gnomes working in under-ground caves in Swansea. None
of the individual gnomes read all the postings either, they just work
together really well.

Talk is cheap. Show me the code

I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer
and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures
more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers
worry about data structures and their relationships.
- Linus Torvalds

Real quality means making sure that people are proud of the code they
write, that they're involved and taking it personally.

I‚Äôm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after

The reader who finds the mathematics too difficult in some places is
urged to do what the mathematician will do when he finds it too
trivial: Skip it.

The decimal system by itself proves nothing except that nature was a
poor mathematician in giving us ten fingers (instead of a number the

Now when you're explaining a 'why' you have to be in some framework
that you allow something to be true. Otherwise you're perpetually

Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to consider moving the parenthesis

Bracket the original problem between the simplest version of the
problem you cannot solve and the fullest version of the problem you
can solve. Then try to move your brackets.

BTW, I never give "trick questions" about real mathematical
content. There is no need; mathematics is already tricky. :-)
- Keith Devlin

The only way that problems get solved in real life is with a lot of
hard work on getting the details right. Not by some over-arching
ideology that somehow magically makes things work.
- Linus Torvalds

In fact, one of the design principles behind git was to make forking
easy, and not have any technical barrier (like a "more central
repository") that held back forking. Forking is important, and forking
needs to happen any time there is a developer who thinks that they can
do a better job in some area. Go wild, fork the project, and prove
your point. Show everybody that you can make improvements.
- Linus Torvalds

We're all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That aline should
