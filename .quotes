<Lukhas> ".JAVA" ??!
<Lukhas> burn in flames, double heretic
<Erwin> You can't just burn in flames. You need to instantiate a
        OxygenStream then on top of that a BufferedOxygenConsumer then give
        that as parameters to a FlameProducerConsumerFactoryQueue.

[...] after an engaging debate at work today where some suggestions
included 'conundri', 'conundrae', 'conundinomie',
'conundrinopigomipingus' - all of which I dismissed as being utterly
uneducated guesses. I do not believe in the concept of overbearing
pedants. Pedantry is a rare and beautiful thing these days and the
mere sniff of it brings joy to my heart. So my hearty congrats to all
of you who felt moved enough by this topic to contribute. By the way,
the plural is conundrums. But I think conundra sounds posher.

If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake
him up.

The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there
is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding
information.

The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland";
but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.

In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our
programming languages.

So far as I know, when G√∂del gave an axiomatization of the Ontological
Argument, he did not factor in a sub-theory of God‚Äôs aesthetics.

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation
and naming things.

"Ja, es gibt ja halt Zahlen."
"Ja."
"Und mit denen kannst Du dann rechnen."
"Jaaa."
"Und damit kannst Du dann halt so Daten verschl√ºsseln."

Saying that Java is nice because it works on every OS is like saying
that anal sex is nice because it works on every gender.

There's a saying in German about the perfect being the enemy of
the good - every engineer has to learn that lesson.

If I could change one thing, I might try to interest some early
preliterate people in not using their thumbs when they count.

For software, we have this weird world with these weird, really
bizarre fundamental properties [...] I don't look around and see
anything that looks like an address or a pointer. We have objects;
we don't have these weird things that computer scientists misname
'objects'.

Every now and then I feel a temptation to design a programming
language but then I just lie down until it goes away.
- L Peter Deutsch

But to me the idea of the right kind of a program is something
that matches the way I think as cloosely as possible rather than
something that matches the machine as closely as possible.
- Don Knuth

These days, I always point out that you've got to make programs so
that they are testable. And the only way to make a program
testable is to think about that before you write the first line of
code.
- Bernie Cosell

You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline - it
helps if you have some kind of football team, or some nuclear weapons,
but at the very least you need a beer

I once had a girlfriend who went to hear me talk for 90 minutes about
LALR(1) parser generators [...] Needless to say, I married her.

While the author's wildly swerwing train of thought did at one point
flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance
event than a result of even rudimentary lucidity

there is no reward for emacs except the experience of using emacs, and
nothing to be learned by it except humility

While Java has plenty of other opportunities to create non-thread-safe
code, I am not going to create an entirely new and nearly irresistible
vector for doing so.  Iteration and side-effects are how we've been
trained to do things in Java, but we have to learn to do better.
- Brian Goetz

Note that nobody reads every post in linux-kernel. In fact, nobody who
expects to have time left over to actually do any real kernel work
will read even half. Except Alan Cox, but he's actually not human, but
about a thousand gnomes working in under-ground caves in Swansea. None
of the individual gnomes read all the postings either, they just work
together really well.

Talk is cheap. Show me the code
- Linus Torvalds

I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer
and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures
more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers
worry about data structures and their relationships.
- Linus Torvalds

Real quality means making sure that people are proud of the code they
write, that they're involved and taking it personally.
- Linus Torvalds

I‚Äôm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after
myself. First Linux, now git.

The only limiting factor of the Linux operating system is its user.

The reader who finds the mathematics too difficult in some places is
urged to do what the mathematician will do when he finds it too
trivial: Skip it.
- Preface to 'a history of ùö∑'

The decimal system by itself proves nothing except that nature was a
poor mathematician in giving us ten fingers (instead of a number the
has more integral factors, like twelve)

toString() is not a serialization mechanism

Now when you're explaining a 'why' you have to be in some framework
that you allow something to be true. Otherwise you're perpetually
asking 'why'

Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to consider moving the parenthesis
from the end of the method name to the beginning of the function call.

Efter et par timer i selskab med B√©la Tarrs film begynder den lumsk at
