<Lukhas> burn in flames, double heretic

[...] after an engaging debate at work today where some suggestions
included 'conundri', 'conundrae', 'conundinomie',
'conundrinopigomipingus' - all of which I dismissed as being utterly
uneducated guesses. I do not believe in the concept of overbearing
pedants. Pedantry is a rare and beautiful thing these days and the
mere sniff of it brings joy to my heart. So my hearty congrats to all
of you who felt moved enough by this topic to contribute. By the way,
the plural is conundrums. But I think conundra sounds posher.

There is a reason for everything. Sometimes, that reason just sucks.

"Ja, es gibt ja halt Zahlen."
"Ja."
"Und mit denen kannst Du dann rechnen."
"Ja..."
"Und damit kannst Du dann halt so Daten verschlüsseln."

Saying that Java is nice because it works on every OS is like saying
that anal sex is nice because it works on every gender.

The existence of analogies between central features of various theories implies the existence of a general theory which underlies the particular theories and unifies them with respect to these central features.

It's 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up with 1958.
